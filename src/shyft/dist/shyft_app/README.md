## Shyft

### Quickstart

After downloading and launching the `Shyft.dmg` installer, drag and drop
`Shyft.app` into the "Applications" folder. You may then run it from Launch-
pad, as you would with any other undocked macOS app.

### Introduction

`Shyft` is a shift-logging GUI utility designed to help data annotators
more effectively track and manage their service and billing records. It
uses the `tkinter` GUI framework, which, as of this writing, is a com-
ponent of Python's standard library.

**NOTE**: This repository is under active development. Because `Shyft` 
is a decidedly new project, documentation is rather sparse at the moment.
We're working hard to compile a robust corpus of helpful, high-quality
resources for our users' reference, so we encourage you to check back
frequently! :)
