## Shyft
`v0.1`

*June, 2024*

----

### Introduction

`Shyft` is a shift-logging GUI utility designed to help data annotators more 
effectively track and manage their service and billing records. It uses the 
`tkinter` GUI framework, which, as of this writing, is part of Python's 
standard library.

### Quickstart Installation Guide
You can install `Shyft` via a number of methods, but the easiest, by far, are 
the pre-packaged `Shyft.dmg` (for macOS users) or `ShyftSetup.exe` 
(for Windows users).

#### macOS
If you're using macOS, you can install `Shyft` by downloading `Shyft.dmg`, 
opening it, and then dragging and dropping the `Shyft.app` file into the 
`Applications` folder.

#### Windows
If you're using Windows, you can install `Shyft` by downloading and running 
the `Shyft_Installer.exe` file. The installation wizard will guide you through 
the setup process. Once it's complete, you can run the program from the Start 
menu.

**NOTE**: This repository is under active development. Because `Shyft` is a 
decidedly new project, documentation is rather sparse at the moment. We're 
working hard to compile a robust corpus of helpful, high-quality resources for 
our users' reference, so we encourage you to check back with the project's 
[GitHub page](https://github.com/kosmolebryce/shyft) every now and then.

Thanks for your support!
