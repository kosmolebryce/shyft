## **OpenClams**: Annotators Unite

### Introduction

**OpenClams** (**O**rganized **P**rofessionals for the **E**thical I**n**tegration
of **C**rowdsourced **L**abor with **A**lgorithmic **M**anagement **S**ystems) is 
a workers' union whose mission is to promote, propagate and protect the interests 
of data annotators worldwide. To those ends, our community of  developers have 
graciously devoted a substantial amount of their time and effort to creating 
for OpenClams a suite of programs will hopefully prove to be of use to all 
data annotators for years to come.
