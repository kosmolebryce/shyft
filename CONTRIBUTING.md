## **ENCLAIM**: Annotators Unite

### Introduction

**OpenClaims** (**O**rganized **P**rofessionals for **E**thics in **N**etworking with
**C**rowdsourced **L**abor and **A**lgorithmic **I**nternal **M**anagement **S**ystems)
is a workers' union whose mission is to promote, propagate, and protect the interests 
of data annotators worldwide.

To those ends, we have created a suite of programs that will hopefully prove to be of
use to all data annotators for years to come. `Shyft` is one such program.
